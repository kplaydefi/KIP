## Details of the contract fees charged by ecological co-builders in the K-play platform
K-play will provide a dedicated interface for ecological co-builders to deploy the corresponding contracts. During this period, co-builders will pay an official fee (automatically deducted from the contract), which will be charged in KUSD and is currently set in the following two types.

The first type is the fee for activating a valid user account of the community. After registration of a new user, the co-builder needs to activate a valid address for this user to be eligible and have access to the K-play application interface, while the co-builder is associated with the account to obtain a share of the user's post-transaction fees. At this stage, it costs 1 KUSD to activate one valid address.

The second is the fee for the deployment contract of the application (game). The fee for single application deployment is now set at 1KUSD, and if the co-builder involves multiple application deployments, K-play will officially charge monthly by package type.

#### Please stay tuned for any changes
