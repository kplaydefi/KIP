K-play issues the token KPT and allows users to stake, mint (loan) or participate in more activities on it. You can obtain the only circulation medium KUSD in all the applications through minting after staking KPT.

When the KPT holder uses K-play (a DApp that interacts with the smart contracts) to stake his KPT as collateral, it will mint to generate KUSD. You can obtain KUSD which is currently supported by 400% stake rate. The stake rate may increase or reduce through community governance mechanism in future. KPT staker will generate debt when minting KUSD. If you need to exit the platform or terminate the agreement (i.e. unlock the KPT), you can destroy the debt by giving KUSD back.
