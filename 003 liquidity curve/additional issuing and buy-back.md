## Introduction of liquidity curve
Liquidity curve is a solution for controling KPT's liquidity. 
We develop a set of algorithm for controling the KPT's issurance and buy-back. 
Liquidity curve is a smart contract with many functions including collecting number of KPT in staking / price of KPT/ price of KUSD in spec time. 
We use liquidity curve to compute the number of KPTs for additional issuing and buy-back.
Liquidity curve algorithm is more complex because it uses many params (these params are on above ).Â
